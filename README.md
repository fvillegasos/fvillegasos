Hi, I’m Fran (@fvillegasos), I'm a software engineer that have been working mostly in Back-End (java-spring) for distributed systems.

I'm really passionate about code efficiency and I'm trying to improve my understanding of Big-0, Time Complexity and cleaner solutions for my work.
Most of the time I have worked with Java LTS (11, 17, 21), but I'm interested in learning new languages (Go or Python) or expanding my knowledge to another fields of software engineering.
